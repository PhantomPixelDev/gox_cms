**Hey there!** Glad you stumbled upon GoX CMS. This project is my playground for experimenting with Go and HTMX to discover the cool interactions they can offer when combined. GoX CMS aims to provide a snappy, secure, and enjoyable content management experience that doesn't feel like a chore.

## Why GoX CMS? ü§î

The motivation behind GoX CMS was to explore the high-performance capabilities of Go and the dynamic, JavaScript-free interactivity offered by HTMX. It serves as a sandbox for experimenting, learning, and breaking things (intentionally!) in a controlled environment. It's also an open invitation for anyone curious about Go and HTMX to dive in and explore.

## What's Cooking? üç≥

As of now, GoX CMS is in its experimental phase - not quite ready for prime time but evolving rapidly. It incorporates:

- **Go**: For robust backend functionality.
- **Fiber**: Offering an Express-like framework but for Go.
- **GORM**: For efficient database management.
- **HTMX**: To refresh pages dynamically without reloading.
- **Bootstrap & BootsWatch**: For stylish UI components.
- **Quill.js**: For sophisticated text editing.
- **Redis**: For fast caching solutions.
